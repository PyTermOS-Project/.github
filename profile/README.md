# Welcome to PyTermOS Organization! ðŸ¤—
Here you can all PyTerm-related projects!
## Products ðŸ¤ 
### PyTerm ðŸ¥¹ 
A custom terminal for MacOS, that was discontinued due to the creation of PyTermOS.

It was a great project, free and open-source. 

It was made for people that are learning how to use Bash, etc.

Basically, it's just a terminal application for beginners.
### PyTermOS ðŸ¤©
A Linux distribution for people that are learning how to use Linux systems and for starters.

It is powered by PyTerm and has got a CLI interface.

Super fast, useful and pretty.
### JuicePackage ðŸ˜ƒ
drink juice in PyTermOS using JuicePackage.

add new flavours if this flavour bored you.

basically it's just a package manager for PyTermOS.

(and macOS/Linux too)

oh and it's still in development so PyTermOS is so you can contribute.
